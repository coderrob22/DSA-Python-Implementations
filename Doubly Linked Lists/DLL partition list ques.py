# DLL: Partition List ( ** Interview Question)
# Write a method called partition_list(self, x) that rearranges the nodes in a doubly linked list so that all nodes with a value less than a given number x come before all nodes with a value greater than or equal to x.

# You must maintain the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

# The partitioning must be performed in-place. You cannot create new nodes (other than dummy nodes).

# Both .next and .prev pointers must be updated correctly.

# If the list is empty, nothing should happen.





# ðŸ§ª Examples

# Example 1
# Input DLL:
# 3 <-> 8 <-> 5 <-> 10 <-> 2 <-> 1
# Partition value: x = 5
# Output DLL:
# 3 <-> 2 <-> 1 <-> 8 <-> 5 <-> 10

# Why:

# Nodes < 5: 3, 2, 1

# Nodes >= 5: 8, 5, 10

# Order of nodes is preserved in both groups

# Smaller group comes before larger/equal group



# Example 2
# Input DLL:
# 1 <-> 2 <-> 3
# Partition value: x = 5
# Output DLL:
# 1 <-> 2 <-> 3
# Why:
# All nodes are already less than x. No rearrangement needed.



# Example 3
# Input DLL:
# 7 <-> 8 <-> 9
# Partition value: x = 5
# Output DLL:
# 7 <-> 8 <-> 9
# Why:
# All nodes are >= x. Order remains the same.



# Example 4
# Input DLL:
# 1
# Partition value: x = 2
# Output DLL:
# 1
# Why:
# Single-node list. Nothing to rearrange.



# Example 5
# Input DLL:
# (empty)
# Partition value: x = 3
# Output DLL:
# (empty)
# Why:
# Empty list. Nothing to do.
