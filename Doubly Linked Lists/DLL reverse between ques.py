# DLL: Reverse Between ( ** Interview Question)
# Write a method reverse_between that reverses a portion of a doubly linked list in place.

# You are given a start index and an end index (inclusive range). Reverse only the nodes between those indices.

# Indexing is zero-based.

# The list is made of nodes with both next and prev pointers.

# Make sure the list remains fully connected after the reversal in both directions.

# If the list has fewer than two nodes or the start and end indices are the same, leave the list unchanged.


# Examples

# Input:  1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 5,  start_index = 1, end_index = 3  
# Output: 1 <-> 4 <-> 3 <-> 2 <-> 5
 
# Input:  10 <-> 20 <-> 30 <-> 40,  start_index = 0, end_index = 2  
# Output: 30 <-> 20 <-> 10 <-> 40
 
# Input:  1,  start_index = 0, end_index = 0  
# Output: 1
