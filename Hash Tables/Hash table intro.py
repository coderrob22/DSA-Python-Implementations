# 1)Hash tables are one way, meaning you send the key through the hash and it gives you a number (address), but you cannot undo that or send the address to give you the key.
# 2)Hash tables are deterministic, meaning every time we put the certain key in we expect to get that hash.... deterministic means we know the address

# python includes a built in hash table: dictionaries
