# You are given a singly linked list that contains integer values, where some of these values may be duplicated.

# Note: this linked list class does NOT have a tail which will make this method easier to implement.

# Your task is to implement a method called remove_duplicates() within the LinkedList class that removes all duplicate values from the list.

# Your method should not create a new list, but rather modify the existing list in-place, preserving the relative order of the nodes.

# You can implement the remove_duplicates() method in two different ways:



# Using a Set - This approach will have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. You are allowed to use the provided Set data structure in your implementation.

# Without using a Set - This approach will have a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. You are not allowed to use any additional data structures for this implementation.



# Here is the method signature you need to implement:

# def remove_duplicates(self):


# Example:

# Input:

# LinkedList: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5

# Output:

# LinkedList: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 

def remove_duplicates(self):
    current = self.head
    while current:
        # Start checking from the next node
        runner = current
        while runner.next:
            # If the next node's value matches current's value, skip it
            if runner.next.value == current.value:
                runner.next = runner.next.next
                self.length -= 1
            else:
                runner = runner.next
        current = current.next
